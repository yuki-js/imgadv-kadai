"""Query 6 (GPU placeholder)

Spec recap from [`further-discussion-prompt.md`](further-discussion-prompt.md:12):
- Build a classifier using subspace method + train data.
- Visualize its decision boundary in a 3D plot.
- Evaluate accuracy on test.
- Decision boundary is a quadric surface.

This file is created as a scaffold so `src-gpu/` output structure matches the spec.
Implementation will follow after Query7 pipeline is stabilized.
